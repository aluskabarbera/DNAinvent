# DNAinvent
This application is to treat amino acid sequences.

Requirements:
Have the latest version of Python.
Install or have the pip package manager installed. (It's very simple, there are many tutorials where they explain it.)
And finally run the command pip3 install colorama in the terminal.
  
How born this code:
This program is the result of my interest in science, and the help of several programmers of a Discord servers. 
Where in 2021, I saw a video on YouTube where he explained that someone had associated nitrogenous bases with binary numbers (0; 1).
So with my little knowledge of the logic of the Python programming language. I started.
I asked a classmate for help, and in the end we got it.
I was excited, I saw that I could continue to extend the code and program what they taught us in compulsory secondary science here in Spain.
So I kept scheduling and asking for help on various Discord servers.
And over time this code was formed.
Where in the end I added the CRISPR associated protein/cas9 and a function that do and count permutations.
   
Functioning:
It's very simple, you just have to read and follow the steps.
In principle, it should only recognize the nitrogenous bases (A, T, U, C and G). You should write down the results.
Hope you enjoy the app. Ah, remember with great power comes great responsibility. 

Acknowledgment:
I thank all the programmers who have helped me, and myself.

Maintenance:
This code is under a license (although I think I have the wrong license, because I have no idea of licenses.) But in it you are free to run it wherever and whenever you want, to be able to modify it and distribute it freely.

Post data: If you modified something, and it was for the better, could I know?
